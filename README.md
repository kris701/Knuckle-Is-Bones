# Knuckle Is Bones
This is a simple fan game version of the minigame Knucklebones from Cult of the Lamb, with the somewhat visuals of Baba is You.
The game is all about ***Dice***, and getting the biggest combos possible to beat your opponents!

The game currenctly contains:
* 3 opponents
* 5 dice
* 8 board

The game has a shop system, where the the more points you gain by winning against opponents, the better dice er larger boards you get get!

This game is still Work in Progress and i appreciate any input you can give :)
