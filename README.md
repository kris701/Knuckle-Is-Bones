# Knuckle Is Bones
This is a simple fan game version of the minigame Knucklebones from Cult of the Lamb, with the somewhat visuals of Baba is You.
The game is all about ***Dice***, and getting the biggest combos possible to beat your opponents!

The game currenctly contains:
* 6 opponents
* 6 dice
* 8 board
* 18 shop items

The game has a shop system, where the the more points you gain by winning against opponents, the better dice er larger boards you get get!

This game is also fully moddable! You can add boards, dice, opponents, shop items, change textures and much more.

This game is still Work in Progress and i appreciate any input you can give :)
